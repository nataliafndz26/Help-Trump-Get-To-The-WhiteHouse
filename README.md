# HELP TRUMP GET TO THE WHITE HOUSE | CANVAS GAME

## Objective

This is the first project built after we finished the 1st module at Ironhack. It consists in a desktop-version game where you must help Donald Trup to reach the White House. 

Our little Trump will run to get his objective but he will find some obstacles (dancing Obamas) on his way that he can jump or dodge by jumping onto a platform. 
If he hits an obstacle he must answer a question with your help. Questions only have one right answer among three possibilities, 
choose the right one before the time runs out! (10 seconds). 

If your answer is not correct or you do not answer on time you will loose a life. If your answer is correct you can keep on running.

## Keys to play

* SPACE: jump
* A - B - C: answer the questions

## ENJOY!
